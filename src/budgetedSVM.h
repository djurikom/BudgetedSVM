		\brief Dimensionality of the classification problem, MUST be set by a user (default: 0)
		
		Although the dimensionality of the data set can be found from the training data set during loading, we ask a user to specify it beforehand, as it is usually a known parameter.
		The reason why we require this as an input is to speed up processing of the data, since the emphasis of the software is on speeding up the training of classification algorithm on 
		large data, and this little piece of information can help avoid unnecessary bookkeeping tasks. More specifically, the parameter is important for memory management of 
		\link budgetedVector\endlink, where it is used to find how many weight chunks of size \link CHUNK_WEIGHT\endlink are needed to represent the data.
		
		However, in the case of Matlab interface, it is not required to manually set this parameter as it is easily found by reading the dimensions of the

	*/
	/*! \var unsigned int NUM_SUBEPOCHS
		\brief Number of training subepochs of AMM batch algorithm (default: 1)
		
		AMM batch has an option to reassign data points to weights several times during one epoch. In the most extreme case, if \link NUM_SUBEPOCHS\endlink is equal to the 
		size of the data set, we obtain AMM online algorithm. This parameter specifies how many times we reassign points to weights within a single epoch.

	*/
	/*! \var unsigned int K_PARAM
		\brief Frequency k of weight pruning of AMM algorithms (default: 10,000 iterations)
		
		In order to reduce the complexity of the learned model, which directly improves generalization of the model as shown in the AMM paper, pruning of small non-zero weights is performed. 
		\link K_PARAM \endlink specifies the frequency of weight pruning, i.e., after how many iterations we perform the pruning step. Aggressiveness of pruning is controlled

	*/
	/*! \var double C_PARAM
		\brief Weight pruning parameter c of AMM algorithms (default: 10.0)
		
		In order to reduce the complexity of the learned model, which directly improves generalization of the model as shown in the original AMM paper, pruning of small non-zero weights is performed. 
		C_PARAM specifies the aggressiveness of weight pruning, where larger value results in pruning of more weights. More specifically, we sort the weights by their L2-norms,
		and then prune from the smallest toward larger weight until the cumulative weight norm exceeds value of C_PARAM. Frequency of pruning is controlled by \link K_PARAM \endlink parameter.
	*/
	/*! \var unsigned int CHUNK_WEIGHT
		\brief Size of chunk of \link budgetedVector \endlink weight (whole vector is split into smaller parts) (default: 1,000)
		
		While \link CHUNK_SIZE \endlink helps when one is working with large data with many data points, this parameter helps when working with high-dimensional data.
		When the data is sparse, then we do not have to explicitly store every feature as most of them are equal to 0. One option is simply to follow LIBSVM format, and
		store a vector in two linked lists, one holding feature index and the other holding the corresponding feature value. However, we found that accessing this data structure can become prohibitively slow, as for
		high-dimensional data weights can become less sparse than the original data due to the weight update process. For example, when we want to update a specific feature during gradient descent
		training we would like to do it very quickly, most preferably we would like to have random access to the element of the weight vector that will be updated. We address this by storing a  
		vector into linked list, where each element of the linked list, called <em>weight chunk</em>, holding a subset of features. For example, the first chunk would hold features indexed from 1 to 
		CHUNK_SIZE, the second would hold features indexed from CHUNK_SIZE+1 to 2*CHUNK_SIZE, and so on. If all elements of a weight chunk are zero, we do not allocate memory for that array. 
		In our experience, this significantly improved the training and testing time on truly high-dimensional data, such as on URL data set with more than 3.2	million features. If \link CHUNK_WEIGHT \endlink is equal to 1, we obtain the LIBSVM-type representation.
	*/
	/*! \var unsigned int CHUNK_SIZE
		\brief Size of the chunk of the data loaded at once (default: 50,000 data points)
		
		While \link CHUNK_WEIGHT \endlink helps when one is working with high-dimensional data, this parameter helps when working with large data with many instances.
		If the data set is very large and can not fit into memory, we can then load only a small part of it (called <em>data chunk</em>), that is processed before being discarded to make room for the next
		chunk. Therefore, we load only a smaller part of the large data set, with size of this chunk specified by this parameter.
	*/
	/*! \var unsigned int BUDGET_SIZE
		\brief Maximum number of weight per class of AMM algorithms, OR size of the budget of BSGD algorithm, OR number of landmark points in LLSVM algorithm (default: 50)
		
		- AMM: As the number of weights in AMM algorithms is infinite, we can set the limit on the number of non-zero weights that can be stored in memory. This can be done in order
		to avoid memory-related problems. Once the limit is reached, we do not allow creation of new non-zero weights until some get pruned.

		- BSGD: Maximum number of support vectors that can be stored. After the budget is exceeded, \link MAINTENANCE_SAMPLING_STRATEGY\endlink specifies how the number of support vectors is kept limited.
		
		- LLSVM: In addition, it also specifies the number of landmark points in LLSVM algorithm, that are used to represent the data set in lower-dimensional space using the Nystrom method.

		- BSGD: Whenever a number of support vectors in BSGD algorithm exceeds \link BUDGET_SIZE\endlink, one of the following budget maintenance steps is performed, depending on the value of the MAINTENANCE_SAMPLING_STRATEGY parameter
			- 0 - deleting random support vector to maintain the budget
			- 1 - take two support vectors and merging them into one. The new, merged support vector is located on the straight line connecting the two existing support vectors; where exactly on the line is explained in \em computeKmax() function from \em bsdg.cpp file. Then, the two existing support vectors are deleted and the merged vector is inserted in the budget. Note that kernel function for BSGD when merging strategy is chosen defaults to Gaussian kernel. (default setting)
		
		- LLSVM: Specifies how the landmark points, used to represent the data set in lower-dimensional space using the Nystrom method, are chosen.
			- 0 - landmark points are randomly sampled from the the first loaded data chunk
			- 1 - landmark points will be cluster centers after running k-means on the first loaded data chunk (default setting) 
			- 2 - landmark points will be cluster medoids after running k-medoids on the first loaded data chunk

	/*! \var unsigned int K_MEANS_ITERS
		\brief Number of k-means iterations in initialization of LLSVM algorithm (default: 10)
		
		In order to find better lower-dimensional representation of the data set using Nystrom method, k-means can be used to improve the choice of landmark points. Unlike in random sampling
		of landmark points from the data set, cluster centers of k-means will represent \link BUDGET_SIZE\endlink points used for the Nystrom method.

	*/
	/*! \var double LAMBDA_PARAM
		\brief Lambda regularization parameter; higher values result in more regularization (default: 0.0001)
		
		The parameter defines the level of model regularization, where larger values result in less complex model (i.e., more regularized model). The parameter is used in all BudgetedSVM algorithms with the same effect, and decreasing the value of this parameter leads to more overfitting on the training set. When compared to C parameter used in LibLinear solver which is employed in LLSVM algorithm, LAMBDA_PARAM is exactly reciprocal (i.e., LAMBDA_PARAM = 1 / C).

		If this parameter is set, the output scores should be interpreted as follows. For LLSVM the score represents the distance of test example from the separating
		hyperplane; for AMM and BSGD this score represents difference between the winning-class score and the score of a class that had the second-best score.

	/*! \var unsigned int KERNEL
		\brief Choose the kernel function for kernel-based algorithms, 0 - Gaussian kernel, 1 - polynomial kernel, 2 - linear kernel (default: 0)
		
		The parameter indicates which kernel function is used in kernel-based algorithms. Note that there is no such choice for AMM. The following kernels are available for two input data points x and y:
		
		- Gaussian: K(x, y) = exp(-0.5 * \link KERNEL_GAMMA_PARAM\endlink * ||x - y||^2)
		
		- Exponential: K(x, y) = exp(-0.5 * \link KERNEL_GAMMA_PARAM\endlink * ||x - y||)
		
		- Polynomial: K(x, y) = (x^T * y + \link KERNEL_COEF_PARAM\endlink)^\link KERNEL_DEGREE_PARAM\endlink
		
		- Linear: K(x, y) = (x^T * y)
		
		- Sigmoid: K(x, y) = tanh(\link KERNEL_DEGREE_PARAM\endlink * x^T * y + \link KERNEL_COEF_PARAM\endlink)

	/*! \var unsigned int VERY_SPARSE_DATA
		\brief User set parameter, if a user believes the data is very sparse this parameters can be set to 0/1, where 1 - very sparse data; 0 - not very sparse data (default: see long description)
		
		When computing the kernels between support vectors/hyperplanes kept in the available budget in budgetedVector objects on one side, and the incoming data points on the other, we have two options: (1) we can either do the computations directly between the support vectors and data points that are stored in budgetedData; or (2) we can do the computations between the support vectors and data points that are in the intermediate step stored in the budgetedVector object. When the data is very sparse option (1) is faster, as there is very small number of non-zero features that affects the speed of the computations, and the overhead of creating the budgetedVector instance might prove too costly. On the other hand, when the data is not too sparse, then it might prove faster to first create budgetedVector that will hold the incoming data point, and only then do the kernel computations. The reason is partly in a slow modulus operation that is used in the case (1) (please refer to the implementation of linear and Gaussian kernels to see how it was coded).
		
		If a user does not manually set this parameter to 0 (i.e., instructs the toolbox to compute kernels as in case (1)) or 1 (i.e., compute kernels as in case (2)), the default setting will be 0 if the sparsity of the loaded data is less than 5% (i.e., less than 5% of the features are non-zero on average), otherwise it will default to 1. For this default behavior that is adaptive to the found data sparsity a developer can set this parameter to anything other than 0 or 1.

	for each chunk only if it contains at least one element that is non-zero. This is especially beneficial for very sparse data sets, where we can have considerable 
	memory gains. Each chunk has a pointer to it stored in \link array\endlink, and a pointer is NULL if the chunk has all zero elements; non-NULL pointer points to a chunk 
	that has allocated memory and which stores elements of the vector.

		\brief Array of vector chunks, element of the array is NULL if all features within a chunk represented by the element are equal to 0.
		
		When the data is sparse, then we do not have to explicitly store every feature as most of them are equal to 0. One option is simply to follow LIBSVM format, and
		store in two linked lists feature index and the corresponing feature value. However, we found that updating this data structure can become prohibitively slow, as for
		high-dimensional data the weights can become much less sparse than the original data due to the weight update process, and the insertion of new elements into vector and vector traversal becomes very slow. 
		We address this by storing a vector into structure that is a vector of dynamic arrays, where original, large vector is split into parts (or chunks), and each part is stored in an
		array within the vector structure. If all elements of the large vector within a chunk are zero, we do not allocate memory for that chunk and \link array\endlink element for this chunk will 
		be NULL. In our experience, this significantly improves the training and testing time on very high-dimensional sparse data, such as on URL data set with more than 
		3.2 million features and only 0.004% non-zero values. If \link parameters::CHUNK_WEIGHT \endlink is set to 1, we obtain the LIBSVM-type representation where each chunk

			- For AMM batch, AMM online, Pegasos:	The model is stored so that each row of the text file corresponds to one weight. 
			The first element of each weight is the class of the weight, followed by the degradation of the weight. The rest of the row corresponds to non-zero elements of the weight, given 
			as \a feature_index:feature_value, in a standard LIBSVM format.
			
			- For BSGD: The model is stored so that each row corresponds to one support vector (or weight). The first elements of each weight correspond to alpha parameters for each class, 
			given in order by \a LABELS row. However, since alpha can be equal to 0, we use LIBSVM format to store alphas, as -\a class_index:class-\a specific_alpha, where we
			added '-' (minus sign) in front of the class index to differentiate between class indices and feature indices that follow. After the alphas, in the same row the elements of the 
			weights (or support vectors) for each feature are given in LIBSVM format.
			
			- For LLSVM: The model is stored so that each row corresponds to one landmark point. The first element of each row corresponds to element of linear SVM hyperplane for that particular
			landmark point. This is followed by features of the landmark point in the original feature space of the data set in LIBSVM format.
